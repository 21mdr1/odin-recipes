    <h3>How to Store Mozzarella Sticks</h3>
    <p>Store (completely cooled) homemade mozzarella sticks in an airtight container in the fridge for up to five days. Line the container with paper towels to absorb excess oil.</p>


    <h3>Can you Freeze Mozzarella Sticks?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze mozzarella sticks. Allow them to cool completely, arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet, cover, and freeze for a few hours or overnight. Once the sticks are frozen, transfer them to a zip-top bag labeled with the date. Freeze for up to three months.</p>


    <h3>How to Reheat Mozzarella Sticks</h3>
    <p>Reheat refrigerated or frozen mozzarella sticks in the oven. To reheat refrigerated cheese sticks, place them in an oven preheated to 350 degrees F for about 5 minutes, or until heated through. To reheat frozen cheese sticks, place them in an oven preheated to 450 degrees F for 10-15 minutes, or until heated through.</p>
